## Background

[Generate Windows Terminal
Scheme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blake-mealey.generate-wt-scheme) is a
VSCode extension for, well, generating [Windows Terminal colour
schemes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/customize-settings/color-schemes). What
does it generate them from? The currently active VSCode colour theme!

I built this because I wanted my VSCode and Windows Terminal to match, and I must say I am super
happy with the results!

_<center>Using the [Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) theme</center>_

In fact, I was so happy with it, I even used colours from Night Owl for this website, so now my
editor, terminal, and website are all matchy-matchy.

## Usage

To use it, first install it in VSCode. Then, open your command pallette with <Shortcut>Ctrl+Shift+P</Shortcut>,
type 'Generate Windows Terminal Scheme' and hit <Shortcut>Enter</Shortcut>. At this time, there is
no extension API to get the name of the colour theme, so you will be prompted to enter it. When you
enter the name, a new editor will open containing a JSON object.

You can now copy that JSON object, and paste it into your VSCode `schemes` array. To do that, open
VSCode, click on the dropdown in the header bar and click Settings (alternatively, <Shortcut>Ctrl+,</Shortcut>).
Your settings file will open in your default JSON editor. Now find the `schemes` array, and paste
the JSON into it. To use the scheme, add a `"colorScheme": "<your-title>"` property to either the
`profiles.defaults` object, or any of the profile objects in the `profiles.list` array.
